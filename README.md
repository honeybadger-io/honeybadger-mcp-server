# Honeybadger MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for [Honeybadger](https://www.honeybadger.io), providing structured
access to Honeybadger's API through the MCP protocol.

## Installation

First, pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-mcp-server:latest
```

Then, configure your MCP client(s). You can find your personal auth token under the "Authentication" tab in your [Honeybadger User settings](https://app.honeybadger.io/users/edit).

### Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Desktop 

Put this config in `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol), or `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` for [Windsurf](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp). See Anthropic's [MCP quickstart guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) for how to locate your `claude_desktop_config.json` for Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "honeybadger": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "HONEYBADGER_PERSONAL_AUTH_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "HONEYBADGER_PERSONAL_AUTH_TOKEN": "your personal auth token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

Run this command to configure [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code):

```bash
claude mcp add honeybadger -- docker run -i --rm -e HONEYBADGER_PERSONAL_AUTH_TOKEN="HONEYBADGER_PERSONAL_AUTH_TOKEN" ghcr.io/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-mcp-server:latest
```

### VS Code

Add the following to your [user settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings#_settings-json-file) or `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "honeybadger_auth_token",
        "description": "Honeybadger Personal Auth Token",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "honeybadger": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "HONEYBADGER_PERSONAL_AUTH_TOKEN",
          "ghcr.io/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-mcp-server"
        ],
        "env": {
          "HONEYBADGER_PERSONAL_AUTH_TOKEN": "${input:honeybadger_auth_token}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See [Use MCP servers in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers) for more info.

### Zed

Add the following to your Zed settings file in `~/.config/zed/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "honeybadger": {
      "command": {
        "path": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "HONEYBADGER_PERSONAL_AUTH_TOKEN",
           "ghcr.io/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-mcp-server"
        ],
        "env": {
          "HONEYBADGER_PERSONAL_AUTH_TOKEN": "your personal auth token"
        }
      },
      "settings": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Building Docker locally

To build the Docker image and run it locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:honeybadger-io/honeybadger-mcp-server.git
cd honeybadger-mcp-server
docker build -t honeybadger-mcp-server .
```

Then you can replace "ghcr.io/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-mcp-server" with
"honeybadger-mcp-server" in any of the configs above. Or you can run the image
directly:

```bash
docker run -i --rm -e HONEYBADGER_PERSONAL_AUTH_TOKEN honeybadger-mcp-server
```

### Building from source

If you don't have Docker, you can build the server from source:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:honeybadger-io/honeybadger-mcp-server.git
cd honeybadger-mcp-server
go build -o honeybadger-mcp-server ./cmd/honeybadger-mcp-server
```

And then configure your MCP client to run the server directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "honeybadger": {
      "command": "/path/to/honeybadger-mcp-server",
      "args": ["stdio"],
      "env": {
        "HONEYBADGER_PERSONAL_AUTH_TOKEN": "your personal auth token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Command Line Options

```bash
# Run with custom configuration
./honeybadger-mcp-server stdio --auth-token your_token --log-level debug --api-url https://custom.honeybadger.io

# Get help
./honeybadger-mcp-server stdio --help
```
